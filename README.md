# Festify: A Solution for Streamlining Event Management

**Project Overview:**
Festify-Android is a cutting-edge application designed to simplify event management and registration processes. Focused on addressing the challenges faced by institutions and organizations in organizing fests, events, and workshops, it also aims to enhance the experience for individuals attending these events.

**Problem Statement:**
Organizers often struggle with managing invitations and registrations for events, while attendees find it cumbersome to locate registration information and complete lengthy forms. Additionally, unforeseen circumstances may lead to event cancellations, causing challenges for organizers in updating their systems.

**Proposed Solution:**
Festify-Android offers a streamlined solution by allowing users to register once with their information. The app fetches and presents updated event lists, categorized for easy browsing. Users can register for events with a single touch and manage their registrations efficiently. The application also provides the option to cancel registrations easily. This not only simplifies the process for attendees but also facilitates organizers in managing participant details.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive user interface for easy event registration and management.
- Utilization of POST requests for secure login and signup processes.
- Implementation of Constraint Layout for responsive design across various screen sizes.
- Integration of SliderView for dynamic event promotions.
- Utilization of RecyclerView for organized display of tech stacks and events.
- Implementation of Room Database to persistently store and display registered events.
- Use of ViewModels and LiveData for efficient data handling and UI updates.
- Navigation Component and BottomNavigation for seamless navigation between fragments.

**Functionality & Concepts Used:**
- POST request: Secure data transmission for login and signup processes.
- Constraint Layout: Responsive design for diverse screen sizes.
- SliderView: Dynamic event promotion through sliding views.
- RecyclerView: Organized display of tech stacks and events.
- Room Database: Persistent storage for registered events.
- ViewModels: Efficient data handling for enhanced architecture.
